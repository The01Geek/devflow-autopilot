#
# The WORKFLOW-SIDE stale-REJECT dismissal net (issue #1175).
#
# Stale-REJECT dismissal is normally the reviewing agent's Phase 4.4 step
# (skills/review/phases/phase-4-4-github-post.md, which runs
# scripts/dismiss-stale-rejections.sh). When the agent never reaches Phase 4.4
# — the exact clean-exit failure mode issue #1156 records — a subsequent APPROVE
# leaves the pull request sitting behind a superseded CHANGES_REQUESTED, with
# nothing else in the system able to clear it. This helper is the net devflow.yml's
# `command` job runs after the review engine to close that gap.
#
# It is a NET, not a replacement: dismiss-stale-rejections.sh is idempotent and only
# ever clears a SUPERSEDED review (a dismissed review becomes state DISMISSED and no
# longer matches; a review whose reviewed tree is still the current head is refused,
# never dismissed). It reads the reviewed tree from the verdict marker's `head=` when
# the review carries one and falls back to `commit_id` only for a markerless review
# (issue #1247), so the agent's Phase 4.4 run and this workflow run never double-dismiss
# or fight — the second pass over an already-dismissed review is a genuine no-op.
#
# THE GATE (issue #1175, the load-bearing part). The dismissal fires ONLY when the
# verdict for the reviewed HEAD was POSITIVELY DETERMINED as APPROVE. It reuses the
# already-shipped, HEAD-scoped, fail-closed scripts/derive-review-verdict.sh, whose
# `verdict_determined` output distinguishes "APPROVE was positively observed at this
# HEAD" from "APPROVE was DEFAULTED because a reviews query failed". Gating on
# `verdict_determined=true` is what makes a correlated GitHub API degradation unable
# to silently dismiss a live REJECT — the failure mode that makes an unconditional
# workflow-side dismissal WORSE than none at all. Every non-(determined-APPROVE)
# outcome REFUSES and says so on stdout/stderr, never failing silent (AC2). Because
# derive-review-verdict.sh short-circuits to incomplete on ENGINE_ERROR=true before
# any query, an engine-error run is `no-dismiss-undetermined` here and dismisses
# nothing.
#
# Arguments (positional; every one optional, absence fails closed to no dismissal):
#   1  REPO             owner/name (devflow.yml passes github.repository)
#   2  PR_NUMBER        the reviewed pull request number
#   3  ENGINE_IS_ERROR  the engine step's parsed is_error ("true"/anything-else)
# GITHUB_RUN_ID (env) scopes derive-review-verdict.sh's comment fallback to this run.
# $DEVFLOW_GH overrides the gh binary (the same seam the rest of devflow uses).
#
# Output (stdout, exactly one token, always emitted):
#   dismissed                — determined APPROVE; dismiss-stale-rejections.sh
#                              dismissed all its own superseded REJECT(s) (or found
#                              none outstanding — a clean no-op).
#   dismiss-refused          — determined APPROVE; dismiss ran but left at least one
#                              of its own REJECTs outstanding because it could not be
#                              shown superseded (dismiss exit 3, issue #1029).
#   dismiss-failed           — determined APPROVE; a dismiss query or a dismissal
#                              call failed (dismiss exit 1). A REJECT may still block.
#   no-dismiss-reject        — the verdict was positively a REJECT; the change-request
#                              must stand, so nothing is dismissed.
#   no-dismiss-undetermined  — the verdict was NOT positively determined (genuinely
#                              verdict-less, an engine error, an unresolvable
#                              HEAD/PR/REPO, or a failed reviews/comments query). The
#                              fail-closed arm: no dismissal on a defaulted verdict.
#   unavailable              — a required sibling helper (the deriver or the dismisser)
#                              is missing/unreadable in this deployment; nothing is
#                              dismissed (Phase 4.4 remains the only path).
#
# Always exits 0 — the workflow step that consumes this runs under always() and must
# never change the invoking job's pass/fail. It is best-effort: any failure refuses
# the dismissal (fails toward leaving a REJECT standing), never toward clearing one on
# an unestablished verdict.
