"""State owner for the `/devflow:create-issue` fresh-context audit lifecycle.

The audit lifecycle — rounds, verdicts, revisions, bounded retries, user-chosen
rounds, overrides and presentation eligibility — used to live as procedural prose
in `skills/create-issue/SKILL.md`, re-derived by an LLM on every turn. Deterministic
transition logic does not belong on an instruction-following surface: this module
owns it, and the skill records events through it and obeys its answers (issue #546).

WHAT THIS OWNS vs. WHAT THE SKILL KEEPS. This module owns transition legality,
round numbering, budget/retry accounting, arm routing, digest computation and
comparison, sentinel generation and comparison, T1/T2 evaluation, override records,
presentation eligibility and the audit-summary field set. The skill keeps the audit
*reasoning* — the audit-prompt template, dimension checklist, information diet,
out-of-bounds lists, extension forwarding — plus the subagent dispatch, the
`VERDICT:` token parse (semantic extraction is LLM work; this module then validates
the token fail-closed against its closed set), the draft-file writes, and every user
interaction. This module never posts an issue.

TWO-CLASS CLI CONTRACT (the skill branches on exactly this):
  * Query subcommands ALWAYS exit 0 and answer on stdout with a decided single-line
    token — fail-closed answers included. A crashed read is never presented as a
    value. Queries are strictly READ-ONLY: the tool-unavailability fallback depends
    on a mutation-persistence failure still leaving the queries answering, so no
    query may write. This is why the eligibility token is *derived* on demand rather
    than persisted at issue time.
  * Mutation subcommands exit non-zero with a specific named stderr breadcrumb, for
    an illegal transition and for an unpersistable state alike.
  * `emit-body` is neither: it is a gated emitter. It exits 0 with the audited body
    bytes when eligibility grounds them, and non-zero with EMPTY stdout otherwise —
    so on the file-identity ground a caller that ignores the exit code cannot post an
    unaudited body. On the event-ordering and override grounds the gate refuses bytes
    a recorded revision has staled, but it cannot byte-bind what it emits (those
    grounds record no trustworthy digest — the disclosed weaker identity); the
    post-hoc creation attestation is the detection surface for that residual.

WINDOWS-SAFETY (#275/#295): this module never executes a `.sh` helper ([WinError 193])
and reads no config file. Its only subprocess is native `git`, and its state file is
anchored to the git repo root (falling back to the cwd) — deliberately NOT to the main
worktree root the draft file uses via `resolve-main-root.sh`. That divergence is
load-bearing and must not be unified: main-root anchoring would share one record across
concurrent worktree runs, letting a foreign delete-first wipe this run's state.

# ── The transition table (the vocabulary registry and lockstep record) ─────────────────
# One row per transition. The verdict-on-arm rows are consulted at runtime by
# _legality(); the other events' rows are the audited record of each cmd_* guard,
# kept honest by the tests' count-and-content lockstep rather than by a runtime read.
#
# This table is deliberately NOT a "single source of truth", and nothing here claims it is
# — read the split above literally. Only the verdict-on-arm rows decide anything at runtime;
# every other row is DOCUMENTATION of a guard that is hand-coded imperatively in its cmd_*
# function. Known, accepted limitation (raised on PR #552 and kept): a cmd_* guard edited
# without its row (or vice versa) can silently disagree, and the lockstep does not catch it
# — the lockstep checks table-vs-registry consistency, not table-vs-cmd_*-behavior.
# It is accepted rather than fixed because the fail-direction is bounded: the guards ARE the
# enforcement, so a drifted row cannot admit a wrong value, corrupt state, or skip a guard —
# it can only mislead a reader. That is a docs-accuracy risk, not a fail-open one.
# Revisit if any of these change: (a) a non-verdict-on-arm row acquires a runtime reader (at
# which point drift stops being cosmetic and this table must become authoritative for it),
# (b) a drift between a row and its guard actually reaches main, or (c) the cmd_* guards are
# reworked such that consulting legal/reason from the rows stops being a rewrite of each one.
# Every row names the tokens it references; the import-time
# assert below rejects any token outside its canonical set, so a renamed arm, verdict,
# marker, override kind or reason token fails the import loudly instead of silently
# routing a lifecycle event to a rule that no longer matches. The tests derive their
# expected row count from this table (`len(TRANSITIONS)`), so a row added here without
# a matching test row turns the suite RED.
