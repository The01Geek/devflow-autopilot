# Best-effort backstop (issue #356): when a review-engine run dies — the job
# fails, is cancelled, or the runner is lost before the agent can act — flip
# THIS run's `devflow:review-progress` comment from the interim `🚀 Reviewing`
# state to the terminal `❌ Review failed` state so its Status stops lying. This
# is the workflow-level mirror of the agent-side fatal-abort rule in
# skills/review/SKILL.md (the "Fatal review abort after seeding" clause); the
# `❌ Review failed` literal and the run-keyed marker shape are a coupled
# contract with that skill (pinned in lib/test/run.sh).
#
# Contract (mirrors ensure-label.sh / apply-labels.sh / post-issue-comment.sh):
#   - ALWAYS exits 0 — a flip hiccup must never change the invoking job's or
#     step's exit code (finalize_check runs `set -euo pipefail` on a REQUIRED
#     check; devflow.yml's step runs `always()`).
#   - Emits exactly one stderr breadcrumb naming the arm it took — e.g. flipped,
#     comment-absent, status-already-terminal, no-Status-line, missing-args, or
#     read/patch-failure. Each arm names the SPECIFIC condition that fired: a
#     failed comment lookup (`id` rc 1) is reported as a read failure, never as
#     "comment-absent" (rc 2), so an operator is never told the comment does not
#     exist when the read merely failed.
#   - Flips ONLY when the comment exists AND its `**Status:**` line begins with
#     🚀 (interim) — anything else (a written verdict, an agent-side
#     `❌ Review failed`, any terminal glyph) is treated as terminal and left
#     untouched (fail closed to no flip).
#   - The run-keyed marker (`<!-- devflow:review-progress run=<id>-<attempt> -->`)
#     matches ONLY the current run's comment, so an earlier run's comment is
#     never modified.
#
# All GitHub access routes through workpad.py (id/body/patch), which honors
# DEVFLOW_GH — so no bare `gh` caller is introduced (the resolve-gh convention
# holds by construction). The review comment's vocabulary is NOT workpad.py's
# (`Review failed` is unrecognized there and `--status` would stamp the wrong
# glyph), so the Status line is rewritten textually and the full body PATCHed —
# the same full-body-rewrite model the skill itself uses.

# 1. Locate THIS run's comment. The run-keyed marker matches only the current

#    exits mean DIFFERENT things and must not share a breadcrumb: rc 2 is a
#    clean scan that found no comment (flag off, non-PR mode, /pr-description
#    runs, seed failure), while rc 1 is a gh-api/parse failure that never
#    established absence at all (rate limit, 403 token scope, 5xx). Reporting

#    still best-effort no-ops (exit 0); only the diagnosis differs.
