"""Render the /devflow:create-issue Step 3.6 fresh-context audit prompt.

This is the create-issue sibling of ``scripts/render-grounding-block.sh``: the
single deterministic renderer of a load-bearing prompt surface, so the
orchestrator stops hand-emitting the ~2,000-word audit-instruction block into
every dispatch. The canonical prose lives in the committed template file
``skills/create-issue/references/audit-prompt-template.md`` (resolved relative
to THIS file, never the cwd — the repo layout and the vendored-plugin layout
both place ``scripts/`` and ``skills/`` as siblings under one root).

Contract (issue #600):

- Stateless: reads no run state, writes no file, takes no stdin. The only reads
  are the committed template file and — for consumer-dimension forwarding — the
  consumer extension ``.devflow/prompt-extensions/create-issue.md``, resolved
  from the git repo root per the #295 SHARED REPO-ROOT CONFIG CONTRACT (a native
  ``git`` subprocess, cwd fallback; never a ``.sh`` exec — the #275 constraint).
- Closed argument surface: closed-vocabulary mode/arm/hook tokens, a kebab-case
  slug, single-line absolute paths, and the machine-generated sentinel pair. No
  free-text parameter reaches the rendered instruction block: every slot filled
  from an argument (``<slug>``, ``{DRAFT_PATH}``, and the ``{SENTINEL_OPEN}`` /
  ``{SENTINEL_CLOSE}`` pair) is shape-checked at the parse boundary, and the
  draft title never crosses a command line at all — it travels in the
  orchestrator's dispatch preamble prose. (``{CONSUMER_DIMENSIONS}`` is the one
  remaining slot; it is filled from committed consumer-extension file content,
  never from an argument, and is substituted LAST so it is never re-scanned.) The ``--template-file`` /
  ``--extension-file`` test overrides are read-paths that are never substituted
  into the block, and are deliberately left untyped so an explicit empty value
  still selects the root-anchored default (the #295 shared contract) — they are
  outside this claim. The path check bounds shape, not vocabulary (see
  ``_abs_path``).
- Modes, complete by construction: the dispatch arms ``file`` /
  ``embed`` / ``inline`` mirroring ``issue-audit-state.py``'s arm vocabulary,
  plus ``checklist`` (the Step 3.5 self-check), ``extract`` (the generic
  section-extraction hook; the Step 2 ``## Evidence axes`` forwarding consumes
  it as a standalone call, while the Step 3.6 ``## Audit dimensions`` hook
  consumes the same extraction *rule* spliced into a dispatch arm as
  ``{CONSUMER_DIMENSIONS}``, not via a standalone ``extract`` call), and
  ``status-only`` (the orchestrator's fail-fast one-line probe).
- Output contract: stdout's FIRST line is ``render-status:`` with a value from
  the closed set {appended, absent, unestablished}; stdout's LAST line is the
  fixed terminal marker ``render-end:`` on every full render, so a truncated
  delivery is positionally detectable: any tail cut drops the terminal marker,
  whatever the render's last block happens to be (the consumer section is last
  only in checklist/extract mode — the dispatch arms follow it with the
  verdict/cap block). ``status-only`` prints
  exactly the one status line (it IS one line; no end marker).
- Failure (unusable arguments, unreadable template file) exits non-zero with
  EMPTY stdout and a stderr breadcrumb — which, together with out-of-position
  markers, is the no-contract-output signal the skill's degraded arms key on.
