"""state_dir.py -- PRFlow's state-directory resolution contract for the PYTHON readers.

The shell sibling is ``lib/resolve-state-dir.sh``. The two are a COUPLED PAIR and
are edited together: a ``.sh`` cannot be exec'd from these readers on Windows
([WinError 193] -- the issue-#275 rule that keeps ``workpad.py`` reading its
config in-process), and a ``.py`` cannot be sourced into a shell. ``lib/test/run.sh``
pins both against ``lib/rename-map.json``.

THE TRANSITIONAL READ-THROUGH (issue #1002). The canonical directory is
``.prflow/``. A reader falls back to the superseded ``.devflow/`` ONLY when the
canonical path is absent AND the superseded one is present, and every such
resolution writes a stderr breadcrumb naming ``/prflow:init``.

Why a fallback exists here when issue #988 ruled one out for the config KEYS:
``/prflow:init`` registers the marketplace with ``autoUpdate: true``, so a
consumer's PLUGIN can update ahead of any migration run. Without the fallback the
next auto-update resolves an absent config and every ``// default`` extraction
silently reverts -- the exact silent revert the migration exists to prevent,
reached before any breadcrumb or gate could run. A LOUD fallback keeps the tree
working while staying observable, so it is not the unobservable-and-therefore-
permanent fallback #988 rejected. The key-level rule is unchanged: no
read-through for ``devflow_* -> prflow_*``.

Readers that use this: ``scripts/workpad.py``, ``scripts/match-deferrals.py``,
``scripts/match-lint-adjudications.py``, ``scripts/render-audit-prompt.py``.
